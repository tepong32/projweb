understand CSS so you can apply DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
customize your html with classes and ids as needed

author img size must be smaller in blog_home and a little larger in postdetails & userposts(filtered page).
text sizes must be generalized
if-else statements to provide colors (border or bg-color) to be implemented for author.profile.user_group == "<user_group>"
maybe a flex display and filtered posts depending on post.tag in the blog_home page
redirects and "go back" buttons modifications
quickpost link not working
